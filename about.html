    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 2, 1982
        to Mattie Hunter and Emanuel Cranford at Jewish Hospital. I have one older sister, Jasmine, two younger sisters, Angel and Allison, and one younger brother, Justing (Chris).

        I went to Cincinnati Hill's Christian Academy for junior high and high school on an academic scholarship. I lettered 4-years in both basketball and football. I was a pretty good athlete back then. When I didn't get many scholarship offers to play football, I decided to attend the University of Cincinnati to study physical therapy. I didn't do well my first semester, so I dropped out and languished for a while trying to figure out my next move. Then, I decided that I would go into the Armed Services, namely the Navy. They would not take me and the story is too long, so I got waivered into the Army; where I served for four years. And I did a tour in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom I & II, where I earned a bunch of medals and ribbons.

        Upon leaving the Army, I knew I wanted to go back to school, so I re-enrolled back into the University of Cincinnati to study Psychology. I also worked as a waiter during my time in school. The schedule was a good fit for me. When I finally did graduate, I decided that I needed a big boy job that would utilize my newly acquired skills and degree. I found a good job working for the county as an Eligibility Technician in the jobs division. I worked hand-in-hand with people who, in some cases had never filled out a job application before. I also worked closely with recruiters from different industries. I figured that I could do that job too. Plus, I was getting burnt out with that job. So, I moved to Denver, CO where I took a job as a junior technical recruiter. I spent two years in Denver. I met my fiance there. We got pregnant pretty early in our relationship. We stayed in a two-bedroom apartment spending way more money that we should. I owned a home in Cincinnati, so we decided to move back.

        Today, I am the proud father of two children, a son and daughter, Isaiah (8) and Zoe (6), and the fiance of their wonderful mother, Jamie. We live in a 4 bedroom home in Maineville, OH, just north of Cincinnati. I coach my son's football and basketball teams.
